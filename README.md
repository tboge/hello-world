# hello-world

Hi - Enter some changes here in my test repo to see how I can commit and do pull requests

Thats all for now.  CU!

Well this is change #2 edits.  Still not quite sure how this works.  Pull Request allows for someone to review your edits and pull into their branch.  Once pull request is approved it is merged into master.  You have to commit first and then pull request
